*In LaTeX "%" denotes a comment
*"Article" documentclass do not have chapters 
*Chapters only avaible in "book" & "report" classes
"\\" creates a new line
Table of contents created by "\tableofcontents" command at the beginning of the document


*Avoid entry in ToC
Whenever we write commands like \chapter{...}, \section{...}, the title is mentioned in the table of contents that is generated. 
There are situations when you would not like the entry in ToC. 
This is achieved by appending a * to the command. For example, consider the commands \chapter*{Introduction} or \subsection*{Time-Table}. 
There will not be any entry of Introduction and Time-Table in the Table of Contents.

*Special Characters
Special characters like ! @ * ( ) - + = ? [ ] / can be written as is in the document. 
Unlike them, there are certain characters which need to be written with an escape character (\), 
else they either throw an error or do not display the way we want.
 Some of them are $ & % _ {  } # which are thus are written as \$  \&  \%  \_  \{   \}   \#

*Dashes
i.Hyphen (-) is mostly used in between two words, e.g. (two-sided). 
ii.En dash (\textendash) is mostly used when specifying range of pages, years, etc. E.g. pages 5 -- 7 explain XYZ
iii.Em dash (\textemdash) (longer than En dash) is mostly used in place of parentheses or colon. 
E.g. Where there is love there is life --- Mahatma Gandhi

*Quotes
Single and double quotes in a document are usually written using '...' and "..." respectively. LaTeX, on the other hand, denotes different characters for representing the opening and closing of quotes.
 ` symbol (usually present before the Number 1 key on a standard keyboard) represents the opening of quotes while ' represents the closing of quotes.
